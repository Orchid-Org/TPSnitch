# TPSnitch

TPSnitch is a cross-loader Minecraft server utility mod for monitoring server performance. It automatically logs TPS (Ticks Per Second), MSPT (Milliseconds Per Tick), and player count at configurable intervals to a JSON file, making it easy to analyze server health over time.

## Features
- Logs TPS, MSPT, and player count to a JSON file keyed by timestamp
- Configurable log interval, debug mode, and log file name
- Player count tracked via join/leave events
- Resets player count on server restart
- Utility functions for retrieving TPS and MSPT from the server object
- Supports Fabric, NeoForge, and Forge loaders (multi-loader)

## Output Format
The log file is a JSON object where each key is an ISO timestamp, and each value is an object:
```json
{
  "2025-04-23T21:00:00Z": {
    "TPS": 20.0,
    "MSPT": 50.0,
    "PlayerCount": 5
  },
  ...
}
```

## Getting Started
1. Requires Java 21
2. Download the correct jar for your loader (Fabric, NeoForge, or Forge)
3. Place the jar in your server's `mods` folder
4. Start your server

## Configuration
- Log interval, debug mode, and log file name are configurable via your loader's config system
- Logs are saved to a JSON file (default: `tpsnitch_log.json`)

## Advanced Usage
- Developers can call `TPSnitch.getTPS(server)` and `TPSnitch.getMSPT(server)` to retrieve live stats programmatically (where `server` is a `MinecraftServer` instance)
